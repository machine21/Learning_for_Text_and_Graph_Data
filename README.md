# Learning_for_Text_and_Graph_Data

Also named #Graph Mining and Analysis with Python#

Advanced machine learning and combinatorial methods for large scale text and graph data

The course is a part of the Master Data Science in Ecole Polytechnique

## Course Syllabus

  - Advanced graph kernels and classification,clustering / community mining (Louvain, modularity, degeneracy),     

  - Influence maximization models (SIR/SIS, LT, IC,…), degeneracy based spreaders selection.

  - Graph of words advanced topics: tw-icw, graph kernels for document similarity, graph based regularization for text classification

  - Word embeddings, Unsupervised document classification with the Word Mover’s Distance, WMD vs cosine similarity

  - Deep learning for NLP, Supervised document classification (TF-IDF vs TW-IDF), CNNs for sentence classification

  - Keyword extraction for summarization: Graph based keyword extraction, summarization (off line, online), Filipova’s word graph for multi-sentence fusion.
